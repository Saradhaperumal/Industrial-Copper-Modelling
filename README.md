Creating Regression and Classifier Model for Copper data from Industry


Problem Statement:

The copper industry deals with less complex data related to sales and pricing.
However, this data may suffer from issues such as skewness and noisy data, which
can affect the accuracy of manual predictions. Dealing with these challenges manually
can be time-consuming and may not result in optimal pricing decisions. A machine
learning regression model can address these issues by utilizing advanced techniques
such as data normalization, feature scaling, and outlier detection, and leveraging
algorithms that are robust to skewed and noisy data.


Another area where the copper industry faces challenges is in capturing the leads. A
lead classification model is a system for evaluating and classifying leads based on
how likely they are to become a customer . You can use the STATUS variable with
WON being considered as Success and LOST being considered as Failure and
remove data points other than WON, LOST STATUS values.


The solution must include the following steps:

1) Exploring skewness and outliers in the dataset.
2) Transform the data into a suitable format and perform any necessary cleaning
and pre-processing steps.
3) ML Regression model which predicts continuous variable ‘Selling_Price’.
4) ML Classification model which predicts Status: WON or LOST.
5) Creating a streamlit page where you can insert each column value and you will
get the Selling_Price predicted value or Status(Won/Lost)

Approach:

1) Data Understanding: Identify the types of variables (continuous, categorical)
and their distributions. Some rubbish values are present in ‘Material_Reference’
which starts with ‘00000’ value.
2) Data Preprocessing:
● Handle missing values, outliers, and skewness in the dataset.
● Apply appropriate data transformations, such as log transformation,
boxcox transformation, or other techniques, to handle skewness in
continuous variables.
● Encode categorical variables using suitable techniques, such as one-hot
encoding, label encoding, or ordinal encoding, based on their nature and
relationship with the target variable.
3) EDA: Try visualizing outliers and skewness using Seaborn’s boxplot, distplot,
violinplot.
4) Feature Engineering: Engineer new features if applicable, such as aggregating
or transforming existing features to create more informative representations of
the data. And drop highly correlated columns.
5) Model Building and Evaluation:
● Split the dataset into training and testing/validation sets.
● Train and evaluate different classification models, such as
ExtraTreesClassifier, XGBClassifier, or Logistic Regression, using
appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1
score, and AUC curve.
● Optimize model hyperparameters using techniques such as
cross-validation and grid search to find the best-performing model.
● Interpret the model results and assess its performance based on the
defined problem statement.
● Same steps for Regression modelling.
6) Model GUI: Using streamlit module, create interactive page with task input(
Regression or Classification) and create an input field where you can enter
each column value except ‘Selling_Price’ for regression model and except
‘Status’ for classification model
